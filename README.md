* I am **Ibrahim Ajami** ðŸ‘‹
 
* I am a medical doctor from Liberia ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡· working at the intersection of emergency care management and public health
prevention strategies.
I have always had an ingrained passion for healthcare, and this passion has pushed me towards doing an MSc
in International Health and Tropical Medicine at the University of Oxford after a residency in Internal Medicine.
I hold a membership from the Liberia College of Physician and Surgeons (LCPS),
a 2017 Yale University Greenberg World Fellow and a 2016 President Young Professional Fellow of Liberia.
My interests are in healthcare leadership and the prevention of communicable and noncommunicable dieseases.
It is my dream to use my acquired knowledge in building a resilient healthcare system for my country with
the limited resources available.
